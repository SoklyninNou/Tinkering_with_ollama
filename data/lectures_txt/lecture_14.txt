Size of Bayes’ Net
Because each node much encode the probability given its parents, the size of the Bayes’ Net scales exponentially with each new variable, specifically
where
is the number of direct parent,
is the number of nodes, and
is the sample space.
Independence of Bayes’ Net
Encoded in a Bayes’ Net is the implication that any nodes not connected are conditionally independent of each other:
We can then say that
and
are conditionally independent given
, as well as:
D-Separation
In general, proving independence is very tedious since it requires analyzing all
nodes. We should then use the
D-Separation
algorithm to simplify the process.
To prove that
, we ask ourselves if we know
, does knowing
or
affect the outcome:
We can intuitively think of it as if removing
will remove all paths going from
to
.
Example 1:
In the above example,
and
are independent from each other but are not conditionally independent given
.
Example 2:
In the above example,
and
are not independent from each other but are conditionally independent given
.
These two examples highlight how the direction of the arc is important to determine conditionally and unconditionally independence.
Active/Inactive Paths
The quickest way of checking for conditional and unconditional independence is to check for
Active/Inactive Paths
. The common pattern for
Active Triples
are:
Casual Chain:
, where
is unobserved
Common Cause:
, where
is unobserved
Common Effect:
, where
or one of its descendents are observed
If an inactive segment is on the path between two nodes, then the path is blocked. If there is no path form
to
, then they are independent.
