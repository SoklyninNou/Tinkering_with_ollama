Independence
We say two variables
are independent if the outcome of one doesn’t affect the other:
We rarely have absolute independence, instead we might have
Conditional Independence
. In this instance, some variables might be independent if another variable is present. If we say that:
then we can say that A is
conditionally independent
of B given C. Biconditional implication:
This can be applicable when simplifying the chain rule since we can remove any variable that is conditionally independent with the random variable.
Bayes’ Net
Bayes’ Nets
is a technique to compactly describe complex joint distributions using simple, local distributions. This is a graph where the nodes are the variables and the edges indicates conditional independence. Each node should have a probability of the node given its connect nodes.
This means that a Bayes’ Net implicitly encodes a joint distribution:
This formula shows that we can simplify the chain rule of probability to only include the node’s parents. This then implies that anything that is not a direct parent of the node is conditionally independent from the node.
