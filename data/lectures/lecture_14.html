    <h3>Size of Bayes’ Net</h3>
    <p>Because each node much encode the probability given its parents, the size of the Bayes’ Net scales exponentially with each new variable, specifically</p>
    <p>where</p>
    <p>is the number of direct parent,</p>
    <p>is the number of nodes, and</p>
    <p>is the sample space.</p>
    <h3>Independence of Bayes’ Net</h3>
    <p>Encoded in a Bayes’ Net is the implication that any nodes not connected are conditionally independent of each other:</p>
    <p>We can then say that</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>are conditionally independent given</p>
    <p>, as well as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>D-Separation</h3>
    <p>In general, proving independence is very tedious since it requires analyzing all</p>
    <p>nodes. We should then use the <strong>D-Separation</strong> algorithm to simplify the process.</p>
    <p>To prove that</p>
    <p>, we ask ourselves if we know</p>
    <p>, does knowing</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>affect the outcome:</p>
    <p>We can intuitively think of it as if removing</p>
    <p>will remove all paths going from</p>
    <p>to</p>
    <p>.<br><strong>Example 1:</strong><br></p>
    <p>In the above example,</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>are independent from each other but are not conditionally independent given</p>
    <p>.<br><strong>Example 2:</strong><br></p>
    <p>In the above example,</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>are not independent from each other but are conditionally independent given</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>These two examples highlight how the direction of the arc is important to determine conditionally and unconditionally independence.</p>
    <h3>Active/Inactive Paths</h3>
    <p>The quickest way of checking for conditional and unconditional independence is to check for <strong>Active/Inactive Paths</strong>. The common pattern for <strong>Active Triples</strong> are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Casual Chain:</p>
        <p>, where</p>
        <p>is unobserved</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Common Cause:</p>
        <p>, where</p>
        <p>is unobserved</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Common Effect:</p>
        <p>, where</p>
        <p>or one of its descendents are observed</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If an inactive segment is on the path between two nodes, then the path is blocked. If there is no path form</p>
    <p>to</p>
    <p>, then they are independent.</p>
