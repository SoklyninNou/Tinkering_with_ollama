    <h2>Informed Search</h2>
    <h3>Search Heuristic</h3>
    <p>A <strong>Search Heuristic</strong> is a function that estimates how close a state is to the goal. We can use this to set our costs where a higher output of the heuristic function means the edge leads to a state further from the goal and a smaller output means the states is closer to the goal.</p>
    <h3>Greedy Search</h3>
    <p>This algorithm expands to the closest node first. This assumes that the solution is in the sub-tree of the immediate lowest cost edge</p>
    <h3>A* Search</h3>
    <p>In <strong>A* Search</strong>, we keep track of 3 values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>G value/Backwards Cost</strong>: The cost to reach any given node.</li>
      <li><strong>H value/Forward Cost</strong>: The distance from the goal</li>
      <li><strong>F value</strong>: The sum of the backward and forward cost.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Terminates when we dequeue the goal</p>
    <h3>Admissible Heuristic</h3>
    <p>We want our heuristic to be <strong>Optimistic</strong> rather than pessimistic. An admissible/optimistic heuristic is:</p>
    <p>This means that our heuristic should underestimate the true cost of each node to the goal. With this, we can prove the optimality of the</p>
    <p>algorithm.<br></p>
    <p>Let A is the optimal solution and B is the suboptimal solution. Assume that</p>
    <p>chooses B instead of A. An ancestor n of A must have been explored since we reached B. We know that:</p>
    <p>This means that node n should expand before node B, leading to a contradiction.</p>
    <h3>Creating Heuristics</h3>
    <p>Often, admissible heuristics are solutions to relaxed problems. <strong>Relaxed Problems</strong> are a version of the problem without the constraints, i.e. Pac-man without the walls.</p>
    <p>In general, heuristics are defined in a semi lattice. This means that a heuristic dominants another if:</p>
    <p>This forms a semi-lattice where</p>
    <p>. The bottom of the semi-lattice is the zero heuristic, where</p>
    <p>and the top is the exact heuristic.</p>
    <p>Additionally, our heuristic must have consistency. <strong>Consistency</strong> means the edge/arc cost must be less than or equal to the actual cost of the edge/arc:</p>
    <p>A consequence of this is that the f value along the path never increases. Additionally, consistency is a sufficient condition for admissibility</p>
