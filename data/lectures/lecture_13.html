    <h4>Independence</h4>
    <p>We say two variables</p>
    <p>are independent if the outcome of one doesn’t affect the other:</p>
    <p>We rarely have absolute independence, instead we might have <strong>Conditional Independence</strong>. In this instance, some variables might be independent if another variable is present. If we say that:</p>
    <p>then we can say that A is <em>conditionally independent</em> of B given C. Biconditional implication:</p>
    <p>This can be applicable when simplifying the chain rule since we can remove any variable that is conditionally independent with the random variable.</p>
    <h2>Bayes’ Net</h2>
    <p><strong>Bayes’ Nets</strong> is a technique to compactly describe complex joint distributions using simple, local distributions. This is a graph where the nodes are the variables and the edges indicates conditional independence. Each node should have a probability of the node given its connect nodes.</p>
    <p>This means that a Bayes’ Net implicitly encodes a joint distribution:</p>
    <p>This formula shows that we can simplify the chain rule of probability to only include the node’s parents. This then implies that anything that is not a direct parent of the node is conditionally independent from the node.</p>
