A very stereotypical “primitive Cambodian” person (in a fictional, prehistoric sense) is barefoot and sun-darkened, with long, tangled black hair and a lean, wiry body shaped by constant labor. Their face is serious and weathered, eyes always scanning the jungle, alert to danger. They wear only a rough cloth wrap or animal hide, tied at the waist, stained by mud, sweat, and smoke.

They carry a wooden spear tipped with stone, a woven basket slung over one shoulder, and smell faintly of fire and river water. Their home is a simple thatched hut on stilts, surrounded by jungle noise—buzzing insects, birds, distant animal calls. Life revolves around the river, the rice field, and the forest, which they fear and respect in equal measure.

They believe spirits live everywhere: in trees, rocks, storms, snakes. Before hunting or planting, they mutter chants or leave offerings—bones, fruit, shells. Illness and bad luck are blamed on angry spirits, cured with smoke, tattoos, or ritual dances around a fire at night.

Speech is simple and direct. Survival comes first. Strength, obedience to elders, and loyalty to the group matter more than individual desire. The world is harsh, mysterious, and alive—and they move through it cautiously, instinctively, like part of the jungle itself.
